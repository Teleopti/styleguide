//Templates
//
//Every view is different, but in terms of layout we notice and strive for certain patterns. Starting with one of these templates as a base puts us on more even ground from the beginning.
//Obviously, these are only examples and the configuration of the layout grid and elements can be changed to suit your needs.
//These templates are combinations of elements that are more extensively documented in the element chapter.
//
//Note: Con-flex elements are marked by a dashed outline in the styleguide for structure and layout clarification, these should not be visible in the project.

//Basic template
//
//The basic view is a view header and a panel. There are different kinds of panels and layouts within them available.

//Markup: base_template.hbs

//Grid template
//
//This layout provides many options to display and manipulate data. Thanks to helper classes like <i><a href="http://teleopti.github.io/styleguide/styleguide/section-8.html#kssref-8-1">line-flex</a></i> and <i>grounded-actions</i> things stays neatly aligned.
